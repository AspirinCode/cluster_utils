WARNING: There is no atom named "OE2"in the protein residue  GLU_780_A. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from the active site,
this warning may not affect the NNScore.

standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.
