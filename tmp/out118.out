WARNING: There is no atom named "OD1"in the protein residue  ASP_354_A. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from the active site,
this warning may not affect the NNScore.

determine pi-pi and pi-cation interactions. If this residue is far from the
active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.
