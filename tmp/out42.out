WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_15_A. Please use
standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "OE1"in the protein residue  GLU_849_A. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from the active site,
this warning may not affect the NNScore.
