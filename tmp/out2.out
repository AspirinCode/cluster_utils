WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_1_A. Please use
standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "C"in the protein residue  LYS_224_A. Please use
standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine secondary structure. If this residue is far from the active site, this
warning may not affect the NNScore.
