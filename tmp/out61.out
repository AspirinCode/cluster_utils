WARNING: There is no atom named "OE1"in the protein residue  GLU_79_A. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from the active site,
this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "OE1"in the protein residue  GLU_163_A. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from the active site,
this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "OE2"in the protein residue  GLU_163_A. Please
