WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_70_A. Please use
standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_141_B. Please

determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_41_A. Please use

WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_210_B. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.
