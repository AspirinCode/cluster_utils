WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_7_A. Please use
standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_41_B. Please use
standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_45_A. Please use
standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
