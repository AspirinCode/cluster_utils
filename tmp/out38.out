WARNING: There is no atom named "NH2"in the protein residue  ARG_207_B. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.
