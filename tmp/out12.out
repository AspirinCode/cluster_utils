WARNING: There is no atom named "NE2"in the protein residue  HIS_345_A. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-pi and pi-cation interactions. If this residue is far from the
active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_56_A. Please use

determine salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from the active site,
this warning may not affect the NNScore.
