WARNING: There is no atom named "NH1"in the protein residue  ARG_557_A. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "NZ"in the protein residue  LYS_62_A. Please use
standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-cation and salt-bridge interactions. If this residue is far from
the active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.

WARNING: There is no atom named "CE2"in the protein residue  HIS_176_A. Please
use standard naming conventions for all protein residues. This atom is needed to
determine pi-pi and pi-cation interactions. If this residue is far from the
active site, this warning may not affect the NNScore.
